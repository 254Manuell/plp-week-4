# Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

## 🛠️ Tool Used
- **Code Completion Tool:** GitHub Copilot (or Tabnine)

## 📝 Task Overview
This project demonstrates how to sort a list of dictionaries in Python by a specific key. It includes:
- A manual implementation of the sorting function.
- An example of AI-suggested code (from Copilot/Tabnine).
- A comparison of both approaches in terms of efficiency.

## 📄 Code Summary

The main function:
```python
def sort_list_of_dictionaries(data_list, sort_key, reverse=False):
    """
    Sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key.
    """
    return sorted(data_list, key=lambda item: item[sort_key], reverse=reverse)
```

### Usage Examples
- **Sort by age (ascending)**
- **Sort by name (descending)**
- **Sort by grade, then by age**

### Example Output
The script prints the sorted student dictionaries for each case.

## 🤖 AI vs Manual Implementation

Both the manual and AI-suggested implementations use Python’s built-in `sorted()` function with a lambda for the key. For multi-key sorting, a tuple is used in the lambda. The AI-suggested code is nearly identical to the manual version, showing that this is a standard Python approach.

## ⚡ Efficiency

- Both versions are equally efficient, leveraging Python’s optimized sorting.
- No significant performance difference exists, as both use the same algorithm and idioms.

## 🏆 Conclusion

- Both manual and AI-generated solutions are Pythonic and efficient.
- AI tools like Copilot or Tabnine can help you quickly write such utility functions, but understanding the logic is important for customization and debugging.
